Hey guys,

Becky has asked us to see how our labs are being used. I've included excel sheets for our labs that include the information she is looking for EXCEPT for software usage. I'd like you  to look at each lab and do two things: per semester, sort the classes by subject i.e. that all INSY classes in FA19 are grouped together. This will make the second part easier, which is to add the software that is being used by each course to the excel sheet. If each person does half a year (Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer) for the labs it shouldn't take too long. If you aren't sure if a class uses any software I will go through it at the end and fill in any I see. You can decide among yourselves or we can talk about it during the meeting today how the work is going to be designated. Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.
